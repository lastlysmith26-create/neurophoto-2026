# NeuroPhoto Project Review - 2026-02-18

## 1. Dynamic Progress Bar & UX
- **Implemented `DynamicProgressTimer`**: Replaced static loading indicators with a dynamic progress bar that cycles through status messages ("Подготовка модели...", "Рендеринг...", "Финальная обработка...").
- **Estimations**: Added time estimates based on task type (Single: 30s, Parallel: 120s).

## 2. Inline Loading States (Skeleton UI)
- **Removed Blocking Overlay**: Deleted the full-screen blur overlay that blocked user interaction.
- **Added `GenerationPlaceholder`**: Created inline placeholder cards that:
    - Match the aspect ratio of the target image.
    - Show the progress bar inside the card.
    - Maintain the grid layout structure immediately upon clicking generate.

## 3. Parallel Generation Streaming (SSE)
- **Backend Refactoring (`/parallel`)**:
    - Switched from waiting for all 4 images to **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.
    - Images are now streamed to the client one by one as they are completed.
- **Frontend Integration**:
    - Updated `api/client.js` with `generateParallelStream` to handle the EventStream.
    - `PhotoSession.jsx` now updates the placeholder cards individually in real-time.
- **Result**: Users see the first image in ~30 seconds instead of waiting ~2 minutes for the full batch.

## 4. Infinite Generation Workflow
- **Continuous Logic**:
    - "Generate 4 more angles" button now reappears after every generation cycle.
    - New images are **prepended** to the gallery (appear at the top), preserving previous results below.
    - Allows users to generate unlimited variations in a single session.

## Next Steps / Recommendations
- Verify mobile responsiveness of the infinite grid.
- Consider adding "Delete Selected" to manage the growing list of variations.
